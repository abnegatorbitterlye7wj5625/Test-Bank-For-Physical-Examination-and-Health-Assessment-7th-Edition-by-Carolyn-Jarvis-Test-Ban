**MULTIPLE CHOICE**
1. A woman has come to the clinic to seek help with a substance abuse problem. She admits to using cocaine just before arriving. Which of these assessment findings would the nurse expect to find when examining this woman?a. Dilated pupils, pacing, and psychomotor agitationb. Dilated pupils, unsteady gait, and aggressivenessc. Pupil constriction, lethargy, apathy, and dysphoriad. Constricted pupils, euphoria, and decreased temperature
2. ANS: AA cocaine user’s appearance includes pupillary dilation, tachycardia or bradycardia, elevated or lowered blood pressure, sweating, chills, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. The person’s behavior includes euphoria, talkativeness, hypervigilance, pacing, psychomotor agitation, impaired social or occupational functioning, fighting, grandiosity, and visual or tactile hallucinations.
3. DIF: Cognitive Level: Applying (Application) REF: p. 99MSC: Client Needs: Physiologic Integrity: Physiologic Adaptation
4. 2. The nurse is assessing a patient who has been admitted for cirrhosis of the liver, secondary to chronic alcohol use. During the physical assessment, the nurse looks for cardiac problems that are associated with chronic use of alcohol, such as:a. Ventricular Mitral valve prolapse.
   3. ANS: AEven moderate drinking leads to hypertension and cardiomyopathy, with an increase in left ventricular mass, dilation of ventricles, and wall thinning. Ventricular fibrillation, bradycardia, and mitral valve prolapse are not associated with chronic heavy use of alcohol.
   4. DIF: Cognitive Level: Applying (Application) REF: p. 89MSC: Client Needs: Physiologic Integrity: Physiologic Adaptation
   5. 3. The nurse is conducting a class on alcohol and the effects of alcohol on the body. How many standard drinks (each containing 14 grams of alcohol) per day in men are associated with increased deaths from cirrhosis, cancers of the mouth, esophagus, and injuries?a. 2b. 4c. 6d. 8
      4. ANS: BIn men, alcohol consumption of at least four standard drinks per day is associated with increased deaths from liver cirrhosis, cancers of the mouth, esophagus and other areas, and deaths from injuries and other external causes.
      5. DIF: Cognitive Level: Understanding (Comprehension) REF: pp. 89-90MSC: Client Needs: Physiologic Integrity: Reduction of Risk Potential
      6. 4. During a session on substance abuse, the nurse is reviewing statistics with the class. For persons aged 12 years and older, which illicit substance was most commonly used?a. Crack cocaineb. Heroinc. Marijuanad. Hallucinogens
         5. ANS: CIn persons age 12 years and older who reported using during the past month, marijuana (hashish) was the most commonly used illicit drug reported.

         7. 5. A woman who has just discovered that she is pregnant is in the clinic for her first obstetric visit. She asks the nurse, “How many drinks a day is safe for my baby?” The nurse’s best response is:a. “You should limit your drinking to once or twice a ;b. “It’s okay to have up to two glasses of wine a ;c. “As long as you avoid getting drunk, you should be ;d. “No amount of alcohol has been determined to be safe during ;
            6. ANS: DNo amount of alcohol has been determined to be safe for pregnant women. The potential adverse effects of alcohol use on the fetus are well known; women who are pregnant should be screened for alcohol use, and abstinence should be recommended.
            7. DIF: Cognitive Level: Analyzing (Analysis) REF: p. 92MSC: Client Needs: Safe and Effective Care Environment: Safety and Infection Control
            8. 6. When reviewing the use of alcohol by older adults, the nurse notes that older adults have several characteristics that can increase the risk of alcohol use. Which would increase the bioavailability of alcohol in the blood for longer periods in the older adult?a. Increased muscle massb. Decreased liver and kidney functioningc. Decreased blood pressured. Increased cardiac output
               7. ANS: BDecreased liver and kidney functioning increases the bioavailability of alcohol in the blood for longer periods. Aging people experience decreased muscle mass (not increased), which also increases the alcohol concentration in the blood because the alcohol is distributed to less tissue over time. Blood pressure and cardiac output are not factors regarding bioavailability.

               9. 7. During an assessment, the nurse asks a female patient, “How many alcoholic drinks do you have a week?” Which answer by the patient would indicate at-risk drinking?a. “I may have one or two drinks a ;b. “I usually have three or four drinks a ;c. “I’ll have a glass or two of wine every now and ;d. “I have seven or eight drinks a week, but I never get ;

                      9. ANS: CIf a patient admits to the use of illicit substances, then the nurse should ask, “When was the last time you used drugs?” and “How much did you take that time?” The other questions may be considered accusatory and are not conducive to gathering information.
                      10. DIF: Cognitive Level: Applying (Application) REF: p. 94MSC: Client Needs: Health Promotion and Maintenance
                      11. 9. The nurse has completed an assessment on a patient who came to the clinic for a leg injury.

Record the results of the assessment, and notify the physician on State, “You are drinking more than is medically safe. I strongly recommend that you quit drinking, and I’m willing to help ;c. State, “It appears that you may have a drinking problem. Here is the telephone number of our local Alcoholics Anonymous ;d. Give the patient information about a local rehabilitation clinic.
                          10. ANS: BIf an assessment has determined that the patient has at-risk drinking behavior, then the nurse should give a short but clear statement of assistance and concern. Simply giving out a telephone number or referral to agencies may not be enough.

He is restless, has dilated pupils, is sweating, has a runny nose and tearing eyes, and complains of muscle and joint pains. His girlfriend thinks he has influenza, but she became concerned when his temperature went up to ﾰ C. She admits that he has been a heavy drug user, but he has been trying to stop on his own.

                              13. 11. The nurse is reviewing aspects of substance abuse in preparation for a seminar. Which of these statements illustrates the concept of tolerance to an illicit substance? The person:a. Has a physiologic dependence on a Requires an increased amount of the substance to produce the same Requires daily use of the substance to function and is unable to stop using Experiences a syndrome of physiologic symptoms if the substance is not used.
                                  12. ANS: BThe concept of tolerance to a substance indicates that the person requires an increased amount of the substance to produce the same effect. Abuse indicates that the person needs to use the substance daily to function, and the person is unable to stop using it. Dependence is an actual physiologic dependence on the substance. Withdrawal occurs when cessation of the substance produces a syndrome of physiologic symptoms.
